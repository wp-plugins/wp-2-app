Convert your WordPress site into a mobile app... the easy way! For Android and Apple devices.

== Description ==

You've got a great WordPress site, it's responsive and all... but to have an actual APP on Android and Apple phones,
wouldn't that just be so much cooler?
Well, now you can achieve this in a matter of minutes!

This plugin allows you to register your site with our unique app building system at http://wp2app.rappidly.net.
After registration you can choose the platforms on which you'd like to see your app working (Android, Apple or both).
We will then receive your build request and have our app builder create your app for you.
Once the app is created you will see the app information in the final step of the plugin.

Check out this awesome plugin, and let us know if you got any good feedback, we'll be sure to take it on asap!

Note: during registration and status-checking of your app, we communicate with our server at wp2app.rappidly.net via JS.
No code offloading is being done whatsoever, this is merely for registration and status checking options.
